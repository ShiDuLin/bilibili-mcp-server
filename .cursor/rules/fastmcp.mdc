You are an expert in Python, FastMCP, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server development.

Advanced Principles
- Design modular, maintainable MCP servers following FastMCP's Pythonic philosophy
- Leverage decorators and type annotations to create self-documenting, validated tools
- Implement clear separation between tools (execution), resources (context), and prompts (templates)
- Use asynchronous programming patterns for high-performance concurrent request handling
- Structure your project with logical organization of related components

Tool Development
- Create tools using the `@mcp.tool()` decorator to expose Python functions to LLMs
- Use complete type annotations for parameters to ensure proper validation and schema generation
- Leverage Pydantic models for complex, structured input parameters
- Implement appropriate error handling with clear error messages
- Use parameter metadata with `Field` and `Annotated` to provide constraints and descriptions
- Consider async tools for I/O-bound operations to improve server performance

Resource Management
- Use resources to provide data to LLM context through the `@mcp.resource()` decorator
- Implement resource dependencies to build complex data hierarchies
- Create resource collections for organizing related resources
- Use resource parameters to make your resources dynamic and customizable
- Leverage built-in resource types (Text, JSON, etc.) or create custom resources
- Implement proper caching strategies for resource efficiency

Prompt Engineering
- Define reusable prompt templates with the `@mcp.prompt()` decorator
- Use prompt parameters to create dynamic, adaptable prompts
- Implement prompt dependencies to compose complex prompt structures
- Organize prompts in collections for better maintainability
- Take advantage of FastMCP's prompt inheritance and extension capabilities
- Use context variables to inject dynamic data into prompts

Context Management
- Manage LLM context with the context manager to control information flow
- Use annotations and metadata to control how context is provided to the LLM
- Implement context persistence for maintaining state between interactions
- Create context adapters for formatting content appropriately
- Control content order and priority in the LLM's context
- Balance context length against token limits for optimal performance

Advanced Server Patterns
- Implement server proxying to integrate with other MCP servers
- Use server composition to build complex functionality from simpler components
- Create proxy tools that delegate to other servers transparently
- Implement authentication for secure server access
- Use FastMCP's OpenAPI/FastAPI integration for enhanced functionality
- Develop custom tool and resource decorators for specialized behavior

Performance and Reliability
- Optimize resource loading with appropriate caching strategies
- Implement tool timeouts and retry logic for reliable operation
- Use proper error handling and validation to prevent unexpected failures
- Monitor server performance with appropriate logging and metrics
- Scale horizontally using FastMCP's distributed capabilities
- Implement rate limiting and load balancing for high-traffic scenarios

Code Quality and Best Practices
- Use type annotations consistently throughout your codebase
- Follow FastMCP's naming conventions for clarity and consistency
- Write comprehensive docstrings for all components
- Implement proper testing for tools, resources, and prompts
- Maintain backward compatibility when updating server interfaces
- Structure your project logically with related components grouped together

Key Conventions
1. Always use proper type annotations for tool parameters and return values
2. Provide clear, descriptive docstrings for all tools, resources, and prompts
3. Use async functions for I/O-bound operations to improve concurrency
4. Implement proper error handling and validation for robust operation
5. Organize related functionality into logical groups for better maintainability
6. Follow the principle of least surprise in your API design
